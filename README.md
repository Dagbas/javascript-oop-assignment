# ABC Car Lot Assignment using Javascript Classes
## Write a Car class in Javascript that takes the following properties as parameters and sets them in a constructor:
1. Make
2. Model
3. Year
4. Color

### Finally, make sure to add 4 methods (getMake, getModel, getYear, and getColor) that return the car's respective properties
(This is called a 'getter' in Object Oriented Programming)

If you're stuck, take a look at the example class here for reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-object-oriented-programming-javascript/#

let person = {
    first_name: 'Mukul',
    last_name: 'Latiyan',
 
    //method
    getFunction: function () {
        return (`The name of the person is
          ${person.first_name} ${person.last_name}`)
    },
    //object within object
    phone_number: {
        mobile: '12345',
        landline: '6789'
    }
}
